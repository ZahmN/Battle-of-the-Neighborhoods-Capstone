    "# The Battle of the Neighborhoods – Week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "**_NextGen_** is a vegan restaurant that aims to recreate healthier versions of common ‘comfort’ and ‘bar’ foods. **_NextGen’s_** menu is kept simple and affordable to attract younger crowds and those always on the go. Its mission is to make health foods easily accessible and to educate patrons on the importance of making better food choices daily. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Background:\n",
    "**_NextGen_** was an idea that began based on the rising obesity rates in Canada. According to an article titled ‘Obesity in Canada’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_Canada), obesity is a rising health concern that is projected to become the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. In 2004, the Canadian Community Health Survey found that 29% of Canadians 18 and older were obese. In the same year, Ontario, which is one of the three most populated Canadian provinces, was found to have an obesity rate of 22.7%. The article also highlighted the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obesity in populated areas tends to affect young adults ages 16-21.\n",
    "* Individuals partaking in extensive learning often binge on food.  \n",
    "* Stress leads people to overeat in effort to cope with their problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Canadian obesity rates have increased significantly over the past 30 years and what was a health concern is now deemed an epidemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "**_NextGen_** is looking to open a location in Toronto, Ontario Canada. Toronto is the capital of Ontario and the largest city in Canada. Given that the city is heavily populated with an estimated 6.1 million residents, Toronto could be an ideal location. To ascertain the best area to set up shop, **_NextGen_** is looking into venues that may drive high traffic, low competition and in close proximity to locations visited by target audience (i.e. universities, gyms, bars, shopping malls)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Audience:\n",
    "**_NextGen’s_** target market is centered on young adults aged 16-25. Although the hope is to inspire and serve customers of all ages, by targeting a younger crowd, **_NextGen_** hopes to expose patrons to healthy standards as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data:\n",
    "#### Data Description:\n",
    "Based on the target audience and observations in the 'Obesity in Canada' article, universities will be used as a location focal point. Data gathered from the following webpages below have been used to determine the top 3 universities in Toronto Canada:\n",
    "\n",
    "* University of Toronto\n",
    "* York University\n",
    "* Ryerson University\n",
    "\n",
    "Top 3 Toronto Universities:\n",
    "* https://www.4icu.org/ca/ontario/\n",
    "* https://www.edarabia.com/universities/toronto/\n",
    "* https://blog.padmapper.com/2018/10/18/the-8-best-colleges-in-toronto/\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare location data will be utilized for location longitude and latitude analyzation. \n",
    "https://foursquare.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Problem Solving:\n",
    "The Toronto geographical coordinates data will be used as input for the Foursquare API. Using the search_query, the top 3 universities will be queried to pin-point location data. Once the universities have been located, the Foursquare API will be used to locate venues that may be surrounding the universities. The venues to be investigated include:\n",
    "-Gyms\n",
    "-Bars\n",
    "-Shopping Malls\n",
    "These venues were selected based on **_NextGen’s_** mission to encourage young adults in a wide variety of backdrops to eat healthy. This gives fitness enthusiasts, bar hoppers and student shoppers a chance to eat healthy on the go.\n",
    "Using a cluster map, the university with the highest number of surrounding venues will determine **_NextGen’s_** restaurant location. \n",
